# CodeHers

As most of us are aware, women in tech are an under represented group. Even as recent as 2023, only 26.7% of all tech related job positions are held by women. We wanted to address this issue by creating a platform where women can have access to to world class events, specially curated courses and incredible industry opportunities to help them boost their career. This platform caters to all women, whether they are just starting out, resuming their career after a long break or transitioning into a career of technology. We hope our platform will serve as a beacon of hope and motivation where we create a community of women that help each other in their journey to success.

# Technologies Used
We built this project using the MERN stack. We used React for the frontend and Express + MongoDB for the backend. We used Postman to test our apis. We used mongoose to connect to our atlas cluster. 

# Future Work
We plan to expand our project by adding more and more courses, opportunities and events. We also plan on including mentorships into our platform for the all round development of women.
